# barcode_reader_simulator
A Java program that reads a "bar code" and interprets the hidden message. It combines 2D arrays, interfaces, and optical scanning and pattern recognition capabilities.

This was done as part of a class project, which required all classes to be included as inner classes of a main class, "Foothill.Java". The text file includes the project code and the output.

* Given: all the names of the methods and a general description of what the method should do; a sample main() for testing the code
* I wrote the classes and methods
* Program reads a barcode image and translates it into a message. It also reads a message and translates it into an image.
